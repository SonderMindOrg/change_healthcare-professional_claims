# ChangeHealthcare::ProfessionalClaims

This gem provides access to the [v3 Processional Claims API](https://developers.changehealthcare.com/api/Professional-Claims/v3#) from Change Healthcare.
It is primarily a generated swagger client, but does contain a wrapper to make acquiring access tokens in a thread-safe way easier.

This gem is currently in alpha, as it is not yet properly cleaned up and nice to use --- it's just the generated swagger!
Use at your own risk.

```ruby
gem 'change_healthcare-professional_claims'
